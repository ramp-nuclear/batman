class FissionMat:
    """Object that acts like a fission reaction yield matrix.

    Why does this object exist, you ask? Let me tell you a story.
    There once was a man named... Eshed. Yes. Really. A terrible name, I know.
    He loved using matrix objects for things that are matrices. Oh, the fun he
    had with all his reaction matrices! A branching reaction never caused him to
    do anything special, he just added all those branching entries in and he was
    happy as a clam.

    But then came a terrible realization! His matrices differed in between
    locations in space, so that they had to be stored separately, and had to be
    transmitted in full whenever he wanted to tell his lovely worker process
    friends about his matrices! And his matrices were so large, they sank the
    Ethernet boats they were riding on, and were so big they wouldn't fit in
    memory, because there were so many of them! Eshed did love his matrices,
    after all, and could never have enough matrices!

    "But most of those matrices are just repeating fission yield vectors!",
    Eshed yelled. Alas, there was no response, since matrices can't speak.
    Seeing no other way, Eshed went to work. He separated out the repeating
    vector structures, and he cached them on construction, so that if he ever
    wanted to create a vector he already had, he will just get a pointer to his
    old vector.
    Now he still had all his lovely matrices, all tens of thousands of them, and they were
    much lighter without all those pesky branching vectors! His vectors were
    indeed pretty large, as they filled almost the entire isotope column, but
    there were only about 20 of them, which would not sink an Ethernet boat!

    "But I do miss my wonderful full matrices...", Eshed thought to himself,
    longingly. "I should store the information required to make these vectors
    into proper metrices all in one place. Then, whenever I want to have my
    matrix, I can just turn each vector into a sparse matrix, and add them
    all up."

    And so was the first FissionMat object born. Not quite a vector, not yet
    a matrix. More of a promise, really, of matrices to come.
