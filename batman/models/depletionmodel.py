    includes which isotopes are to burn (and at what order), their decay
    matrix and the filtered reaction graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dg - Decay graph, unfiltered.
    reacts - Reaction rates from the transport calculation for this component.
    _filter - User defined filter for the resulting giant graph.
    dtype - NumPy type for vectors etc.
    accumulate - Isotopes that are to be held constant.

    Returns
    -------
    A 3-tuple. The first value is a sequence of isotopes, the second is the
    decay matrix to use and the third is a filter for reaction rates, so we
    can filter out reaction rates that have no effect on the resulting model.
