        ----------

            A function that solves Ax=b for some square matrix A and some vector b.
            This function can require additional keyword parameters.

            .. danger::
                According to Maria Pusa [1], iterative solvers such as BiCGStab and
                GMRES are not suitable for burnup matrices. A check has shown that a full
                decay problem with ~1000 isotopes gives a garbage solution with BiCGStab.
                Therefore, one should choose their solver carefully.
